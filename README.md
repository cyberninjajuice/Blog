# Blog
A CRUD Web Application for Blogging.

## WHO NEEDS THIS BLOGGING WEB APPLICATION INTERFACE?
Well if you are reading this you must be some sort of hipster so my recommendation, go out there and make your hipster friends proud with a new blog about being a lumberjack (especially if you are not male). You could totally like lumberjacking before it becomes cool, you can live on the edge of culture. Or you could just make a blog! So to answer the question? Who needs it? any hipster who dreams of the GREAT NORTHERN PINE but would rather just sit at home where its warm. Hipsters can't use conventional blogging mechanisms like Blogger, Word Press, or Drupal can they? So they need this cool up and coming Blog Interface!

##WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH THE BLOG?
